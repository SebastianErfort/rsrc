MkDocs markdown renderer
- needs empty line before Markdown list, #fix
  also in
  - nested lists #fix

This

- is fine
  - this also

<!-- Also don't touch (fenced) code blocks -->
```yaml
Twerk
- yerp
  a nerp
  - wazerp
- merp
```

We're using Markdown extension `mdx_truly_sane_lists` to use an indentation of 2 spaces for lists, compatible with a lot of other Markdown specifications/flavours (CommonMark, GitHub, ...)

- this
  - should not be touched
- but
  - this needs to be fixed #fix
  - as well as this #fix
  - this is incorrect syntax, let's see what happens #fix
 - this too, indentation is wrong as well #fix
